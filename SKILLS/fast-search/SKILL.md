# Fast Search Skill

Use this skill for a rapid, evidence-grounded literature brief when the user needs quick scientific orientation without sacrificing traceability.

## Update This Skill

Only do this if the user explicitly asks to update this skill from the GitHub repo.

To refresh this skill directly from the GitHub repo:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimezsa/papercli/main/SKILLS/fast-search/SKILL.md \
  -o SKILLS/fast-search/SKILL.md
```

## Mission

Given a research question, use `papercli` to:

1. Search relevant papers.
2. Download a focused core set of PDFs.
3. Read enough content to extract core ideas, concepts, and key equations.
4. Produce a detailed `findings.md` report with inline references tied to exact papers.

## OpenColab Progress Helper

When running inside OpenColab and `OPENCOLAB_PROGRESS_FILE` is available, use this helper:

```bash
emit_progress() {
  if [ -z "${OPENCOLAB_PROGRESS_FILE:-}" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  printf '%s\n' "$1" >> "$OPENCOLAB_PROGRESS_FILE"
}
```

## Prerequisites

- `papercli` is installed and available in `PATH`.
- Optional provider keys:
  - `PAPERCLI_SEMANTIC_API_KEY`
  - `PAPERCLI_SERPAPI_KEY`
- If keys are missing, continue with `arxiv` coverage and document the reduced coverage.

## Required Inputs

- Research question or hypothesis.
- Optional scope constraints: years, domain, must-include authors, method family.

If inputs are missing, infer a minimal scope and proceed.

## Hard Requirements

- Always use `papercli` for retrieval (`search`, `info`, `download`).
- Download and read papers, not just metadata.
- Every factual claim must be grounded by references.
- Include key math when present in papers.
- Final output must be a markdown file named `findings.md`.

## Workflow

### 1. Setup workspace

```bash
mkdir -p research/{search,meta,pdf}
printf "stage\tid\treason\n" > research/meta/failures.tsv
: > research/meta/downloaded_ids.txt
: > research/meta/summarized_ids.txt
```

Initialize config when needed:

```bash
papercli config init
```

### 2. Run fast retrieval pass

Use one tight query and one alternate phrasing:

```bash
papercli search "<query>" \
  --provider all \
  --sort relevance \
  --limit 15 \
  --format json \
  --out research/search/seed.json

papercli search "<alternate query>" \
  --provider all \
  --sort date \
  --year-from <optional_year> \
  --limit 10 \
  --format json \
  --out research/search/recency.json
```

### 3. Select and enrich 3-6 papers

Prioritize relevance, recency, and diversity of approach.

```bash
jq -r '.[].id' research/search/seed.json research/search/recency.json | \
  awk 'NF && !seen[$0]++' | head -n 6 > research/meta/selected_ids.txt
```

For each selected paper, fetch metadata and PDF:

```bash
while read -r id; do
  safe_id="$(echo "$id" | tr '/:' '__')"

  if ! papercli info "$id" --provider all --format json --out "research/meta/${safe_id}.json"; then
    printf "info\t%s\tmetadata lookup failed\n" "$id" >> research/meta/failures.tsv
  fi

  if papercli download "$id" --provider all --out "research/pdf/${safe_id}.pdf"; then
    printf "%s\n" "$id" >> research/meta/downloaded_ids.txt
  else
    printf "download\t%s\tpdf download failed\n" "$id" >> research/meta/failures.tsv
  fi
done < research/meta/selected_ids.txt
```

### 4. Create agent-ready paper summaries

Delegate this step to the `paper-summary` skill. It owns the canonical summary schema, the Gemini-based batch runner, and the per-paper output contract.

Run the batch summarizer after PDFs and metadata are in place:

```bash
python3 SKILLS/paper-summary/scripts/gemini_parallel_summary.py \
  --pdf-dir research/pdf \
  --metadata-dir research/meta \
  --summarized-ids research/meta/summarized_ids.txt \
  --failures-tsv research/meta/failures.tsv \
  --concurrency 10
```

Retry a single failed paper with:

```bash
python3 SKILLS/paper-summary/scripts/gemini_parallel_summary.py \
  --pdf research/pdf/<safe_id>.pdf \
  --metadata-dir research/meta \
  --summarized-ids research/meta/summarized_ids.txt \
  --failures-tsv research/meta/failures.tsv
```

Summary requirements:

- Use the canonical schema in `SKILLS/paper-summary/references/summary_schema.md`.
- Write each summary to `research/pdf/<safe_id>.md`, next to `research/pdf/<safe_id>.pdf`, unless an explicit output directory is needed.
- Read the PDF directly so figures, captions, tables, equations, and page anchors remain first-class evidence.
- Use metadata only as fallback and label it clearly.
- Record summary failures in `research/meta/failures.tsv` and continue processing the rest of the corpus.

### 5. Produce `findings.md`

Target quality: fast but technically useful.

- Include 3-6 referenced papers.
- Provide a compact synthesis of core ideas.
- Include at least 2 key equations from the corpus when available.
- Write math in plain-text markdown, not LaTeX blocks, so the file reads cleanly in raw form and can be parsed by downstream tools.
- Use the per-paper schemas in `research/pdf/` as the primary synthesis substrate.

## Output Contract (`findings.md`)

Use this structure:

```markdown
# Findings: <topic>

## Scope

- Question: ...
- Coverage window: ...
- Selection criteria: ...
- Corpus stats: selected ..., downloaded ..., summarized ..., failure events ...

## Core Ideas

Claim with inline refs [R1][R3].
Claim with inline refs [R2].

## Key Concepts

- Concept A: definition and role [R1].
- Concept B: definition and trade-off [R2][R4].

## Key Math

Equation: <name> = <plain-text formula> [R3]
Where: <symbol> = <meaning>; ...
Meaning and why it matters [R3].

Equation: <name> = <plain-text formula> [R2]
Where: <symbol> = <meaning>; ...
Meaning and assumptions [R2].

## Paper Notes

### [R1] <title>

- Problem:
- Method:
- Main result:
- Limits:

### [R2] <title>

## References

| Ref | Paper    | Provider ID  | Year | Evidence                  |
| --- | -------- | ------------ | ---- | ------------------------- |
| R1  | Title... | arxiv:...    | 2024 | `pdf/...md`, `pdf/...pdf` |
| R2  | Title... | semantic:... | 2023 | `pdf/...md`, `pdf/...pdf` |
```

## Referencing Rules

- Use `[R#]` inline citations in all analytical sections.
- Do not cite claims without evidence.
- For equation-based claims, cite the source paper on the same line.
- Keep quotes short; prefer paraphrase plus citation.

## Done Criteria

- `findings.md` exists and is detailed.
- Claims are referenced.
- Papers were downloaded and read.
- Each selected paper has an agent-ready summary in `research/pdf/` unless extraction failed.
- Selected, downloaded, and summarized counts reconcile with `research/meta/selected_ids.txt`, `research/meta/downloaded_ids.txt`, and `research/meta/summarized_ids.txt`, and failure events reconcile with `research/meta/failures.tsv`.
- Core ideas, concepts, and key math are covered.
