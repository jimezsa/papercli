# Pro Search Skill

Use this skill when the user needs a serious literature synthesis, not a quick scan. This workflow prioritizes methodological depth, cross-paper comparison, and explicit evidence tracking.

## Update This Skill

Only do this if the user explicitly asks to update this skill from the GitHub repo.

To refresh this skill directly from the GitHub repo:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimezsa/papercli/main/SKILLS/pro-search/SKILL.md \
  -o SKILLS/pro-search/SKILL.md
```

## Mission

Answer a scientific question by building a medium-depth evidence base from papers retrieved with `papercli`, then deliver a detailed `findings.md` with:

- Core ideas and major concepts.
- Key mathematical formulations.
- Cross-paper agreements and disagreements.
- Explicit references for every non-trivial claim.

## Prerequisites

- `papercli` is installed and available in `PATH`.
- Optional provider keys:
  - `PAPERCLI_SEMANTIC_API_KEY`
  - `PAPERCLI_SERPAPI_KEY`
- If provider keys are missing, proceed with available providers and document any coverage gaps.

## Hard Requirements

- Retrieval must use `papercli`.
- Download and read the selected PDFs.
- Do not rely on abstract-only synthesis when full text is available.
- Every analytical paragraph must contain `[R#]` citations.
- Final deliverable is a detailed markdown file named `findings.md`.

## OpenColab Progress Helper

When running inside OpenColab and `OPENCOLAB_PROGRESS_FILE` is available, use this helper:

```bash
emit_progress() {
  if [ -z "${OPENCOLAB_PROGRESS_FILE:-}" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  printf '%s\n' "$1" >> "$OPENCOLAB_PROGRESS_FILE"
}
```

Use it only for substantial milestones: retrieval-wave start, candidate-corpus counts, deep-read selection, download progress, summarization progress, synthesis start, warnings, or blocked runs.

## Workflow

### 1. Define research frame

Extract:

- Main question.
- Scope boundaries (domain, years, task setting, constraints).
- Evaluation criteria (accuracy, sample efficiency, robustness, compute, interpretability, etc.).

### 2. Build query matrix and search

Run at least 3 query types:

1. Canonical problem phrasing.
2. Method-centric phrasing.
3. Recent trend phrasing.

```bash
mkdir -p research/{search,meta,pdf}
printf "stage\tid\treason\n" > research/meta/failures.tsv
: > research/meta/downloaded_ids.txt
: > research/meta/summarized_ids.txt

papercli search "<canonical query>" --provider all --sort relevance --limit 25 --format json --out research/search/q1.json
papercli search "<method query>"    --provider all --sort relevance --limit 25 --format json --out research/search/q2.json
papercli search "<trend query>"     --provider all --sort date --year-from <recent_year> --limit 25 --format json --out research/search/q3.json
```

Optional author-centered expansion:

```bash
papercli author "<key author>" --provider all --sort relevance --limit 15 --format json --out research/search/author.json
```

### 3. Select 8-12 papers and enrich metadata

Selection rules:

- Include seminal plus recent papers.
- Include at least two competing approaches.
- Include at least one negative/critical or limitation-heavy paper when possible.

```bash
jq -r '.[].id' research/search/*.json | awk 'NF && !seen[$0]++' | head -n 12 > research/meta/selected_ids.txt

while read -r id; do
  safe_id="$(echo "$id" | tr '/:' '__')"

  if ! papercli info "$id" --provider all --format json --out "research/meta/${safe_id}.json"; then
    printf "info\t%s\tmetadata lookup failed\n" "$id" >> research/meta/failures.tsv
  fi

  if papercli download "$id" --provider all --out "research/pdf/${safe_id}.pdf"; then
    printf "%s\n" "$id" >> research/meta/downloaded_ids.txt
  else
    printf "download\t%s\tpdf download failed\n" "$id" >> research/meta/failures.tsv
  fi
done < research/meta/selected_ids.txt
```

### 4. Create agent-ready paper summaries

Delegate this step to the `paper-summary` skill. It centralizes the summary schema, PDF-first evidence rules, and Gemini-based parallel execution.

Run it after `research/pdf/*.pdf` and `research/meta/*.json` are ready:

```bash
python3 SKILLS/paper-summary/scripts/gemini_parallel_summary.py \
  --pdf-dir research/pdf \
  --metadata-dir research/meta \
  --summarized-ids research/meta/summarized_ids.txt \
  --failures-tsv research/meta/failures.tsv \
  --concurrency 10
```

Retry one paper with:

```bash
python3 SKILLS/paper-summary/scripts/gemini_parallel_summary.py \
  --pdf research/pdf/<safe_id>.pdf \
  --metadata-dir research/meta \
  --summarized-ids research/meta/summarized_ids.txt \
  --failures-tsv research/meta/failures.tsv
```

Summary requirements:

- Use the canonical schema in `SKILLS/paper-summary/references/summary_schema.md`.
- Write each summary to `research/pdf/<safe_id>.md`.
- Treat figures, captions, tables, equations, and layout cues as first-class evidence.
- Mark metadata-only evidence explicitly when the PDF is unreadable.
- Record failures in `research/meta/failures.tsv` so the synthesis step can reconcile counts.

### 5. Synthesize with explicit comparisons

Build an evidence matrix in the report:

- Rows: papers.
- Columns: task, data, method, metrics, strengths, weaknesses.

Then produce:

- Consensus findings.
- Disputed findings.
- Practical implications for the user's question.
- Base the comparison on the structured summaries in `research/pdf/`, not ad hoc free-form notes.

## Key Math Handling

- Extract at least 3 high-signal equations across the corpus when available.
- Write equations in plain-text markdown, not LaTeX blocks.
- Prefer ASCII-friendly notation that survives raw markdown: use forms like `sum_{i=1 to N}`, `E[...]`, `argmax`, `<=`, `>=`, and `^`.
- Use a consistent three-line pattern:
  - `Equation: <name> = <plain-text formula> [R#]`
  - `Where: <symbol> = <meaning>; ...`
  - `Interpretation: <role, assumptions, and trade-offs> [R#]`
- Explain variable meanings and assumptions.
- Tie each equation to a paper reference on the same line.

Example style:

```markdown
Equation: L(theta) = sum\_{i=1 to N} ell(f_theta(x_i), y_i) + lambda \* Omega(theta) [R4]
Where: f_theta = model with parameters theta; ell = per-example loss; Omega(theta) = regularizer; lambda = regularization weight.
Interpretation: Regularized empirical risk objective balancing data fit against model complexity [R4].
```

## Output Contract (`findings.md`)

Use this structure:

```markdown
# Findings: <research question>

## Research Scope

- Question:
- In/Out of scope:
- Corpus size:
- Corpus stats: selected ..., downloaded ..., summarized ..., failure events ...

## Evidence Matrix

| Ref | Paper | Method | Setting | Best reported result | Limits |
| --- | ----- | ------ | ------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| R1  | ...   | ...    | ...     | ...                  | ...    |

## Core Ideas and Concepts

Paragraph-level synthesis with inline refs [R1][R2].

## Key Math

Equation: <name> = <plain-text formula> [R#]
Where: <symbol> = <meaning>; ...
Interpretation [R3].

## Agreements and Conflicts

- Agreement: ... [R2][R5]
- Conflict: ... [R4][R6]

## Practical Takeaways

- Actionable implication 1 [R1][R7]
- Actionable implication 2 [R3][R8]

## References

| Ref | Title | Authors | Year | Provider ID | Source files                              |
| --- | ----- | ------- | ---- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| R1  | ...   | ...     | ...  | ...         | `meta/...json`, `pdf/...md`, `pdf/...pdf` |
```

## Referencing Rules

- Use `[R#]` inline for claims, numbers, and equation interpretations.
- If a claim cannot be cited, remove or soften it.
- Keep any direct quote short and attributed.

## Done Criteria

- `findings.md` is detailed and decision-useful.
- 8-12 papers were processed (or explain shortfall).
- Math, concepts, and evidence-based synthesis are present.
- Each processed paper has an agent-ready summary in `research/pdf/` unless extraction failed.
- Selected, downloaded, and summarized counts reconcile with `research/meta/selected_ids.txt`, `research/meta/downloaded_ids.txt`, and `research/meta/summarized_ids.txt`, and failure events reconcile with `research/meta/failures.tsv`.
- References map back to local metadata, colocated paper summaries, and downloaded PDFs.
